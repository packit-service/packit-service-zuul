## About Zuul CI - softwarefactory-project.io

[Zuul](https://zuul-ci.org) is a CI system invented in the OpenStack community.
[Softwarefactory](https://softwarefactory-project.io) (SF) is project which is hosting services (Zuul being one of them) to ease development of open source projects.

## How it works in our case

We have [softwarefactory-project-zuul](https://github.com/apps/softwarefactory-project-zuul) GitHub App [installed to all packit-service repos](https://github.com/organizations/packit-service/settings/installations).
We have a separate [packit-service tenant in Zuul](https://softwarefactory-project.io/zuul/t/packit-service/status).
It uses the configuration from this repository, see especially [jobs.yaml](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service-zuul/blob/master/zuul.d/jobs.yaml) and [pipelines.yaml](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service-zuul/blob/master/zuul.d/pipelines.yaml) in [zuul.d/](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service-zuul/tree/master/zuul.d).
We can easily use those pipelines & jobs from other repositories so if you have a job which could be used by more repositories, you can add it to [jobs.yaml](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service-zuul/blob/master/zuul.d/jobs.yaml).

If you want to enable Zuul in another packit-service repository, just create a `.zuul.yaml` and define `noop` job inside to test the connection, see [example](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service-zuul/pull/8/files).
Once the testing is done, there is a new comment posted in the PR with links to each job.
If it looks OK, add any other jobs you want and remove the `noop` one.

Your locally cloned repo is: `project_dir: "{{ ansible_user_dir }}/{{ zuul.project.src_dir }}"`
